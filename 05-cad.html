                     <p> Fusion 360</p>
                     <p> For our computer aided design, we are using Autodesk Fusion 360. Fusion 360 allow us to create our design, simulate and analyse the results without actually building the object. In fusion 360, once we are done sketching, we can send the sketch for laser cutting or 3d printing. Here are some sketches of my designs in Fusion 360.</p>

                     <p>This is my first sketch in Fusion 360. It is a keytag with my name on it. Here are the steps to sketch the keytag.<br> 1.Create a new sketch and select the XY-plane as the sketch plane. Under sketch, select Rectangle (2-Point) and draw a 50mm x 15mm keychain body.<br>
2.Select a Circle (Centre Diameter) and place the starting point at midpoint of the left side. The midpoint is indicated by a blue triangle + X when the mouse hover along the line.<br>
3.Draw 2 concentric circles, diameters of 8mm and 4mm at the midpoint. <br>
4.Select Trim and remove the unwanted line segments from the sketch. <br>
5.Select Fillet under Modify and click on a corner of rectangle. Set fillet radius as 3mm and click OK. Repeat for the other 3 corners.<br>
6.Click 'Finish Sketch' and select Extrusion under SOLID. Drag the arrow upwards and key in 2mm.<br>
7.Create a new sketch using the top face of keychain as sketch plane. <br>8.Select Text and click on the sketch plane. type in your name and set the font, then drag the starting point to align the name in the keytag. Click "OK".<br>
9.Click on "Finish sketch" and Extrude the text by 1mm. </p>

                     <p>This is my second sketch in Fusion 360. It is a fidget spinner. </p>
                     <p>2d vector</p>
                     <p>Vector images are made up of paths, each with a vector that tells the path how it is shaped and what color it is bordered. Since each image is defined by algorithms, the quality of a vector image is retained regardless of how it is scaled. This means that the lines and edges will always    be sharp/clear when we zoom in or out. Vector images are comprised of shapes, and each shape has its own color. Therefore, vectors cannot achieve the color gradients, shadows, and shading that raster images can. Vector drawing is best used for designs with shapes filled with solid colours, making it perfect for logos, illustrations, fancy text and engraving.</p>
                     <p>2d raster</p>
                     <p>Raster images are made up of individual pixels of color. When viewed as a whole, the colored pixels make up a vivid and detailed painting. Raster images are ideal for photo editing and creating digital paintings in programs such as GIMP. Furthermore, raster images and can be compressed for storage and web optimized images. The quality of rastor images is defined by the resolution, and is measured in pixels-per-inch (ppi), and the dimensions (pixel Ã— pixel). The highrt the ppi and dimensional measurements, the higher the quality. Quality of image is lost as  rastor images are scaled up. However, we can scale down rastor images to occupy less storage, for example web images.</p>
                     
                     <p>Below are the differences between 2d vector and 2d raster</p>
