                     <p> Introduction to electronics. The term 'electricity' refers to the flow of electronics in a closed circuit. If the switch is turned on, electricity flows around the circuit. If there is a break in the circuit, electricity cannot flow.</p>
                     <p>Formulas: <br>
                     Voltage (V): difference in electric potential between two points, which is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points. <br>
                     Current (A):  stream of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is measured as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface or into a control volume.<br>
                     Resistance (â„¦):  the ratio of the voltage applied to the electric current which flows through it: If the resistance is constant over a considerable range of voltage, then Ohm's law, I = V/R, can be used to predict the behavior of the material.</p>
                     <p>Electrical components</p>
                     <p> Wires: Conductors with resistance that is negligible. <br>
Switches: Electrical components that breaks a circuit when manually operated. When the switch is closed, the circuit is completed.<br>
Resistors: Electric components that provides resistance to the flow. <br>
Diodes: Semi-conductors that allow current to flow in only one direction. <br>
Integrated circuits: Miniaturised electrical circuits that contain thousands of electrical components.</p>

                     <p> Embedded programming using Arduino.</p>
                     <p> Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. The language for Arduino is C language. I used the Arduino Uno to carry out my embedded programmning. Below are some simulation circuits that i created using tinkercad. </p>

                     <p> Now, i will showcase some of the coding that i did in the Arduino software. The code below is describing a pedestrian crossing.</p>
